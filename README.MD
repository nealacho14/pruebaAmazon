The solution to the problem raised was made.

Initially, the machine was set up as necessary, then the necessary folders were structured and finally the classes were created where the methods and other code were generated to be able to meet the requested need.

Some comments are left:

1. The Amazon page for security reasons requests validation through captcha
2. The Drone value cannot be evaluated in the same way as the previous 3 due to the way the portal shows it.
3. The validation of an item when viewing it in the list and viewing it in the cart must be optimized because the title sometimes differs, it could be a bug in the Amazon portal
4. In general terms the test is simple, even though there are details to improve the portal, a number of automated tests are possible.

Note: The delay with the test was due to current work that I could not put aside. My apologies.
